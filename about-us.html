  Welcome to Starbucks Philippines, your home away from home. We are a proud member of the globally recognized Starbucks Corporation,  which has been serving premium coffee since 1971. Our journey in the Philippines began in 1997, when we opened our first store at 6750 Ayala Avenue, Makati City. Since then, we have grown to over 300 stores across the country, becoming a beloved fixture in the local coffee culture.
  <br/>

  At Starbucks Philippines, we are more than just a coffee shop. We are a community. We are a hub for conversation and meeting, a part of the daily routine, and we couldn&#39;t be happier about it. Our mission is to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.
  <br/>
  
  <br/>
  Our commitment to quality is unwavering. We source the finest and freshest ingredients from around the globe, ensuring that every cup of coffee, tea, and every bite of food you enjoy with us is of the highest quality.
